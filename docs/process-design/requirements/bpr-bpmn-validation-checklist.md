## Validation Tools
- [ ] BPMN.io Modeler validation
- [ ] XML Schema validation
- [ ] MDBA EA compliance checker
- [ ] Process simulation tool
- [ ] Documentation completeness checker

## Next Steps
1. Begin validation of end-to-end process
2. Create automated validation scripts
3. Document validation procedures
4. Establish validation review process
5. Create validation report template

## Notes
- All validations should be performed by both automated tools and manual review
- Each validation should be documented with evidence
- Issues found should be tracked in the project issue tracker
- Validation results should be reviewed by stakeholders
- Regular revalidation should be scheduled
