# Introduction

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level summary of the proposed submissions process for the 2026 Basin Plan Review (BPR). It is intended to support shared understanding across the Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) and its stakeholders and inform the design and delivery of the systems and workflows required to manage submissions in line with legislative and operational requirements. This summary captures the end-to-end process, outlines each phase and its key tasks, and highlights critical dependencies, obligations, and process considerations.

## Objectives

The objectives of this summary report are to:

- Present a clear overview of the 2026 BPR submissions process, from initiation through to reporting;
- Identify the key tasks and sub-processes required to manage and meet MDBA’s legislative obligations;
- Highlight user needs, content handling requirements, and key process features that will inform solution design and implementation;
- Provide a reference point for internal engagement and planning;
- Support alignment between business process requirements and supporting technology systems.

## Scope

This document focuses on the public submissions process supporting the 2026 Basin Plan Review. It includes six core process phases:

- **Invitation** – preparation and publication of the Discussion Paper and formal invitation to participate;
- **Collection** – receiving, logging, and storing submissions across multiple channels;
- **Analysis** – initial review, validation, and categorisation of submissions;
- **Consideration** – detailed examination of valid submissions and their influence on final BPR outcomes;
- **Publication of Submissions** – publication of valid submissions with appropriate permissions, redactions, and acknowledgements;
- **Reporting** – preparation and release of the What We’ve Heard and Final 2026 BPR reports.

This report outlines the key activities, decision points, and responsibilities associated with each phase, and includes specific considerations around legislative compliance, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), consent and anonymity, campaign submissions, and high-value insights.

## Supporting Materials

This summary report is accompanied by a set of **Level 2 BPMN process maps** that visually represent the end-to-end submissions process. These maps provide a structured, standardised view of tasks, sub-processes, decision points, and information flows. They are intended to support detailed planning and provide a foundation for process alignment with technical system design.

This summary should be read alongside the **Final Report – Service Concept**, which will provide the comprehensive design brief for the development and implementation of the system(s) and supporting capabilities required to manage the 2026 BPR submissions process.

# Invitation

The Invitation Phase marks the official commencement of public consultation for the 2026 Basin Plan Review (BPR). This phase ensures that the MDBA meets its legislative obligations under the Water Act 2007 by formally inviting submissions from the public and key stakeholders, and setting out a transparent process for participation.

The process begins with the publication of the invitation to respond to the Discussion Paper. This must occur via the Commonwealth Government Gazette, a newspaper circulating in each Basin State and Territory, and on the MDBA’s website. The consultation period must remain open for at least 12 weeks, but will likely be extended to 16 weeks to support broader engagement.

The invitation must include:

- Instructions on how to access the Discussion Paper,
- Submission methods (email, physical address, online portal),
- A clear submission deadline,
- Conditions for publication, including the ability to request confidentiality.

The MDBA must also:

- Make the Discussion Paper available online,
- Send a copy to each State Minister for the Basin States,
- Formally invite each State Government to provide submissions.

To support the quality and consistency of responses, the MDBA will also publish a Submissions Guideline on its website. This document will help stakeholders understand the purpose of the review, the four key themes identified in the Discussion Paper, and provide instructions for submitting feedback. It will also outline important information for submitters: that all valid submissions will be published unless confidentiality is explicitly requested; and that submitted material may be used by the Commonwealth for Commonwealth purposes.

## Key Tasks

Prepare Discussion Paper for Release

This task involves the finalisation of the 2026 BPR Discussion Paper. It ensures that the paper is clearly written, legally sound, and accessible for multiple audiences and platforms. It undergoes legal review, editorial refinements, and formatting for online and print publication.

Publish Official Invitation

This task initiates the consultation process by formally publishing the invitation to make submissions. The invitation must be published in the Commonwealth Gazette, in newspapers across all Basin jurisdictions, and on the MDBA’s website to meet legislative requirements and inform the public.

Distribute Discussion Paper to Basin States

This task fulfils the MDBA’s obligation to formally notify Basin State governments. It includes sending a copy of the Discussion Paper to each relevant Minister and inviting them to make submissions on the review.

Specify Submission Process and Conditions

This task outlines how the public and stakeholders can participate in the consultation. It defines submission channels, sets the deadline, and clarifies the terms under which submissions will be published or kept confidential.

Develop and Publish Submissions Guideline

This task ensures stakeholders are supported with clear guidance on how to respond to the Discussion Paper. The Submissions Guideline outlines key themes, acceptable formats, and publication terms, including consent for Commonwealth use of submission content.

# Collection

The Submission Collection Phase outlines the process through which stakeholders submit formal responses to the Basin Plan Review (BPR) Discussion Paper. This phase commences once the Submission Invitation and accompanying guidance materials are publicly available and concludes when all submissions are received, logged, and verified for further analysis. The process ensures a high level of inclusivity, administrative consistency, and secure handling of sensitive information.

Stakeholders can prepare and lodge submissions in response to the four key themes of the Discussion Paper via multiple channels: an online submission portal hosted by the MDBA, email, or physical (hard copy) submission delivered to an MDBA office. To enhance accessibility and inclusion, MDBA representatives may also facilitate submissions in person by assisting stakeholders to complete their response directly within the online submission portal. This supported submission pathway is designed to accommodate community members who may not have access to digital tools or may require guidance to complete their submission.

Submissions may vary in format (e.g., structured surveys or extended written responses) and media (e.g., written, audio, or video). All submissions, regardless of channel or format, are centralised into a secure repository and assessed for completeness and alignment with the BPR themes. Each is then assigned a unique identifier and verified to ensure eligibility for subsequent phases of analysis and reporting.

# Analysis

The Analysis Phase is the initial step in the review of submissions received through the 2026 Basin Plan Review (BPR). Following the close of the submission window, the focus of this phase is on validating, categorising, and distributing submissions to the appropriate Content or Theme Leads for further examination.

Submissions are reviewed to ensure they are complete, relevant, and accessible. This includes verifying that each submission aligns with at least one of the four key themes outlined in the BPR Discussion Paper. Submissions are then categorised by theme, stakeholder type, and geographic relevance to support efficient processing. To strengthen the quality and utility of the data, sentiment analysis and content tagging tools are applied to extract early insights, detect tone, and identify trends in public opinion.

A critical element of this phase is the identification and grouping of campaign submissions—identical or near-identical responses driven by coordinated advocacy efforts. While such submissions reflect community sentiment, they are grouped and treated as a single entity to streamline processing and reduce duplication during later assessment.

In addition, high-value submissions—those that demonstrate strategic insight, innovative ideas, or evidence-based recommendations—are flagged early. These are triaged and escalated to Content and Theme Leads to ensure they are fully considered in subsequent phases.

Another essential component of this phase is the identification and careful handling of submissions containing Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP). ICIP-related content is flagged through three channels:

- Submitter self-identification as a First Nations person or organisation,
- AI-assisted keyword detection, and
- Manual identification by reviewers.

Flagged submissions are confirmed, protected, and handled in line with MDBA’s Consent to Gather and Use Form and Guide to Engagement. These submissions are transferred to a locked working environment and assigned only to authorised personnel, ensuring respectful and secure processing.

This triage phase establishes a transparent and auditable foundation for the careful consideration of all valid submissions throughout the BPR process.

## Key Tasks

Verify Submission Validity

Confirms that submissions meet the minimum content and accessibility requirements. This includes checking for completion, relevance to the four BPR themes, and appropriateness of content. Submissions that are incomplete or irrelevant are flagged and removed from further review. This task also includes identifying:

- **Campaign submissions** — identical or near-identical responses coordinated by advocacy groups—to be counted and processed as a single collective submission.
- **ICIP –** Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property-to be identified, triaged, handled and assessed in line with each submitters’ Consent to Gather and Use Form (i.e., within a locked-down online workspace (SharePoint) and in compliance with the agreed purpose).

Categorise Submission by Theme and Type

Applies a consistent set of tags to each valid submission to enable filtering by theme, stakeholder type, and geographic relevance. This supports efficient routing and theme-level aggregation.

Triage Submission to Theme Lead(s)

Submissions are assigned to appropriate Theme Leads based on their content. This step ensures all submissions receive appropriate technical review, and that responsibility is clearly allocated across the MDBA's thematic teams.

Prioritise High-Value Submissions

Identifies submissions of significant value—those with innovative insights, deep stakeholder knowledge, or robust evidence. These are flagged for prioritised review and visibility in the subsequent phase.

# Consideration

The Consideration Phase is a legislatively mandated stage of the BPR Submissions Process, where all valid submissions must be reviewed and considered in full. This phase ensures transparency, accountability, and integrity in the handling of public and stakeholder input.

All submissions are assessed using a consistent and auditable method—principally through the use of a 2026 BPR Submissions Consideration Template. This tool ensures that the review process is systematic and that each submission is linked to documented outcomes in both the "What We've Heard" Report and the Final 2026 BPR Report.

The phase involves multiple steps, including: confirming submission assignment, completing the template for each submission, identifying key insights or proposals, and recording how each submission shaped analysis and findings. High-value submissions or those containing technical, policy, or implementation-specific insights are triaged to subject matter experts (SMEs), Theme Leads, or technical working groups to validate, contextualise, and incorporate them appropriately.

A tracking system will also ensure every submission can be traced from intake to its influence on the final recommendations—fulfilling the MDBA’s requirement for a defensible and inclusive consultation process.

## Key Tasks

Assign Submissions to Reviewers

All valid submissions must be formally allocated to staff for review and completion of the BPR Submissions Consideration Template. The assignment process ensures equitable distribution across the review team and accounts for reviewer expertise where relevant (e.g., technical, Indigenous, environmental, or stakeholder-focused content).

Complete Submissions Consideration Template

Each reviewer completes the Consideration Template, documenting the key insights, relevance, and implications of the submission. This template also includes fields for noting if the submission has been addressed in the "What We’ve Heard" Report or warrants further consideration in the Final Report.

Identify and Summarise Insights

Insights from submissions are extracted and grouped for synthesis, particularly where there are common views or divergent perspectives across stakeholder groups. These insights are prepared for Theme Leads and the report-writing teams.

Triage High-Value Content to SMEs or Theme Leads

Where submissions contain technical recommendations, novel evidence, or implementation suggestions, they are triaged to the relevant subject matter experts or Theme Leads. Their input will determine whether the content should shape final policy advice or trigger further investigation.

Record Submission Impact and Reporting Linkage

Each submission’s influence must be explicitly recorded, including how it contributes to the "What We’ve Heard" Report or is carried forward into final drafting. This ensures traceability, completeness, and compliance with legislated requirements.

| 4.5.3 | Sub-process | Maintain Submission Impact Register | Maintain an auditable log showing how all submissions were considered and responded to. |     |

# Publication

The Publication of Submissions Phase occurs concurrently with the Consideration Phase and ensures that the Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) meets its legislated obligation to publish all valid submissions received during the 2026 Basin Plan Review (BPR). This phase supports public transparency by enabling stakeholders to access a wide range of views shared throughout the consultation process.

Unless confidentiality or anonymity is specifically requested, all valid submissions are published to the MDBA website. Prior to publication, submissions are reviewed for sensitive, inappropriate, or confidential material, and any such content is redacted. Additionally, submissions are published under the name of the submitter or organisation unless anonymity is requested.

A critical element of this phase is the need to uphold consent and cultural protocols. Submitters may retract their consent for publication at any time, and the MDBA must act promptly to remove any published content upon request. The publication process must also identify and respect Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) — recognising traditional ownership, attributing contributions appropriately, and avoiding the unauthorised disclosure or public release of culturally sensitive materials. Systems must be in place to flag ICIP content, record appropriate permissions, and ensure ICIP custodianship is respected throughout the publication process.

All actions in this phase are logged in a detailed, auditable publication register that records redactions, submitter permissions, consent retractions, and publication decisions. This supports transparency, legal compliance, and ethical publishing standards.

## Key Tasks

Confirm Publishing Permissions

MDBA reviews submission metadata to determine whether the submitter has requested full publication, anonymity, or confidentiality. Particular attention is paid to any content involving Indigenous knowledge or perspectives. Where ICIP is present or suspected, additional care is taken to confirm appropriate permissions and custodianship.

Review for Redactions

Submissions approved for publication are reviewed for sensitive, confidential, or inappropriate content. This includes identifying material related to ICIP, which may require consultation with the relevant Traditional Owners or cultural authorities before release. All redactions must be documented and justified.

Prepare Submission for Publication

Submissions are formatted for public release, and any redactions or naming preferences are applied. ICIP content is flagged and appropriately acknowledged. If consent for publication has not been formally obtained for ICIP material, it is withheld from publication.

Publish to MDBA Website

Approved submissions are published to the MDBA website, with content categorised by theme and submitter type. ICIP-related content is published only with appropriate permissions and attribution. Systems must support the immediate removal of content if publication consent is withdrawn, or if ICIP custodians request content to be taken down.

Maintain Publication Log

A publication log records all metadata associated with each submission, including redactions, consent preferences, ICIP status, publication status, and any subsequent changes. This ensures transparency and supports MDBA’s legislative and cultural obligations.

# Reporting

The Reporting Phase marks the final stage of the 2026 Basin Plan Review (BPR) submissions process. It focuses on synthesising and documenting the insights gathered through public submissions and stakeholder input, culminating in the release of two key deliverables: the What We’ve Heard Report and the Final Report on the BPR.

The What We’ve Heard Report is the first public output from the consideration of submissions. It presents a thematic summary of the feedback received, reflecting the range of views, values, concerns, and recommendations provided across different stakeholder groups and geographic regions. The report does not include policy decisions but aims to transparently convey the breadth and diversity of input. All relevant insights must be traceable to source submissions through an auditable process established in the Consideration Phase.

The Final Report presents the outcomes of the BPR process, including any proposed amendments to the Basin Plan. It draws on the What We’ve Heard Report, detailed submission consideration records, and supporting analysis from internal and external experts. Both reports must uphold the MDBA’s standards of transparency and traceability, including accurate representation of ICIP content and high-value contributions from stakeholders.

This phase also includes an organised notification and communication process to inform submitters, stakeholders, and the public of the reports' release. Where possible, tailored messages are sent to stakeholders who made a submission, especially where their input is directly referenced in the reports. Communication products are aligned with the MDBA’s broader engagement and media strategy.

## Key Tasks

Draft and Finalise the What We’ve Heard Report

Collates and summarises submission content under relevant BPR themes, stakeholder groups, and geographic zones. Highlights key issues and values raised, without making policy decisions. Ensures transparent referencing of submission data and incorporation of ICIP content in line with established permissions.

Draft and Finalise the Final Report

Presents the outcomes of the Basin Plan Review, incorporating data from submissions, expert input, modelling, and analysis. Includes a summary of how submissions informed the final recommendations and decisions. This document becomes the formal product of the 2026 BPR.

Notify Submitters and Stakeholders of Report Releases

Implements a structured process to notify submitters and key stakeholders of report publication. Messages are tailored to reflect the stakeholder's role in the process and may include references to specific contributions where appropriate.

Publish Reports to MDBA Website and Recordkeeping Systems

Final reports are made available via the MDBA website and entered into official recordkeeping systems. Accessibility and searchability are ensured, and publication is compliant with records management and legal requirements.
