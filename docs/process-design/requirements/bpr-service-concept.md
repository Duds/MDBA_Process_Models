# **How to Use This Document** {#how-to-use-this-document}

This progress document provides a structured and partial view of the MDBA Basin Plan Review Submissions Service Concept. It is intended to support internal review, stakeholder engagement, and alignment during the design and implementation planning phases.

It includes:

* A summary of the service context and design objectives

* The high-level structure linking Personas → Archetypes → Journeys → Blueprints

* Focused journeys and blueprints

* Core design principles and elements that underpin the full-service concept

**This version is not a complete service specification**. Instead, it highlights the foundational thinking and priority components relevant at this stage of the project. Full journey coverage, system requirements, capability maps, and supporting appendices will be provided in the final submission.

1. **Introduction**

   1. **Context**

The Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) is legislatively required under Section 51 of the Water Act 2007 to undertake a comprehensive review of the Basin Plan every ten years. In preparation for the 2026 review, the MDBA has initiated the redesign of its public submissions process to ensure it is fit-for-purpose, scalable, inclusive, and compliant with legislative, privacy, and cultural obligations. This service concept builds on the insights captured during the Discovery Phase (April 2025), where internal deep dives, legislative reviews, and user persona mapping were undertaken to frame the needs, risks, and functional expectations of the process.

Key contextual drivers include:

* **Legislative obligations** under the Water Act 2007 to invite and consider submissions from both Basin States and the public for a minimum of 12 weeks.

* **Diverse stakeholders** including community members, First Nations representatives, state governments, campaign groups, and MDBA internal teams.

* **Submission format complexity**, including text, image, audio, video, and oral formats — requiring flexible intake and analysis systems.

* **Privacy, FoI, and ICIP compliance** requirements for handling, redacting, and publishing sensitive or cultural information.

* **Volume expectations** of 5,000–10,000+ submissions, with potential for high-volume campaign participation.

* **System requirements** for secure, onshore storage (Azure), WCAG AA compliance, and robust consent tracking and redaction workflows.

* **Feedback and transparency expectations**, including *"What We've Heard"* reporting and visible submission status tracking.

* **Alignment to enterprise frameworks** such as DAMF and MDBA's Enterprise Architecture principles (e.g., Configure-before-Code, reuse-first approach).

This concept sets the foundation for service delivery planning, governance alignment, and user-centred co-design in the implementation phase.

2. **Objectives for the Service**

The future submissions process described in this service concept is a critical enabler of the MDBA's statutory obligations under the Water Act 2007 and broader commitments to inclusive, transparent, and ethical consultation. The process must accommodate a wide range of submitters and submission types, while also ensuring compliance, security, and operational efficiency.

This service concept supports the MDBA in delivering a future service model that is:

* Inclusive and accessible to all stakeholder groups — including First Nations, regional communities, advocacy bodies, and government stakeholders.

* operationally scalable and capable of handling high volumes of submissions, including diverse formats and campaign-style inputs.

* Legally defensible and compliant with key legislation, including privacy, ICIP, FoI, and records management requirements.

* Transparent and accountable, with visible pathways from submission to consideration, and mechanisms for timely feedback and reporting.

* Adaptable and sustainable, allowing for future reuse, iteration, and cross-program application within MDBA.

The objectives below reflect the strategic focus areas for the future submissions process:

**Table 1: Strategic Focus Areas**

|  | Design a seamless, guided intake experience that supports multiple channels and formats. |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | Embed privacy, consent, and ICIP protections throughout the lifecycle of each submission. |
|  | Enable workflow automation, redaction, triage and routing to support internal processing efficiency. |
|  | Support real-time reporting, analytics, and campaign monitoring to inform public communication and executive insight. |
|  | Provide transparent status tracking, public reporting, and publishable outputs that meet accessibility and compliance standards. |
|  | Align with MDBA enterprise architecture, data governance, and digital service standards. |

3. **The Purpose of a Service Concept**

The service concept defines the future vision for how MDBA will deliver and operate the Basin Plan Review submissions process. It sets out the intended experience for users, the system capabilities required to support that experience, and the design principles that will guide implementation.

Rather than prescribing detailed solutions, this concept provides a structured foundation to align stakeholders, support co-design, and inform downstream artefacts such as journey maps, service blueprints, and system requirements.

It ensures the future process is user-centred, legally compliant, and operationally sustainable — while supporting transparency, trust, and reuse across the broader BPR program.

More information on the Service Concept is at [**Appendix I**](#bookmark=id.oz5d38jmbfzn).

4. **Personas, Archetypes, Scenarios, Journeys, & Blueprints**

This service concept uses a layered design model, progressing from user research through to implementation tools. The structure ensures traceability of user needs and alignment with system and process design. The pathway is:

### **Personas** {#personas}

Initial user personas were developed during discovery to capture granular motivations, behaviours, and concerns. These included First Nations storytellers, community advocates, industry reps, and public sector coordinators, among others.

### **Archetypes** {#archetypes}

Personas were synthesised into five representative archetypes to anchor the design of systemic journeys:

| Archetype | Represents... |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Engaged Contributor** | Individuals and groups lodging submissions |
| **Process Steward** | Internal triage and workflow managers |
| **Platform Guardian** | IT and data custodians |
| **Compliance Custodian** | Legal and privacy reviewers |
| **Strategic Synthesiser** | Analysts and policy advisors using submission data |

### **Scenarios** {#scenarios}

Scenarios illustrate key situations and user interactions across the submission lifecycle, enabling designers to test edge cases, identify system requirements, and validate user needs in context. Scenarios developed for this process included:

* Community Citizen lodging a public submission

* First Nations Representative navigating ICIP consent protocols

* Government official submitting jurisdictional feedback in structured form

* Campaign group lodging large volumes of coordinated submissions

* Internal MDBA staff triaging, analysing, and processing submissions

These scenarios draw on user research and internal deep dives, including specific requirements for diversity of media types, campaign submission handling, consent workflows, and privacy and security compliance

### **Customer Journeys** {#customer-journeys}

Each archetype is mapped to an end-to-end customer journey showing key phases, activities, system touchpoints, and emotional states. These journeys are the backbone of service design.

### **Service Blueprints** {#service-blueprints}

Journeys are then translated into detailed blueprints. Each blueprint provides:

* Touchpoints and technology

* Staff roles and backstage actions

* Supporting processes, policies, and artefacts

* Risks and system requirements

This structured approach enables MDBA to design inclusively while ensuring legal defensibility, scalability, and stakeholder transparency.

5. **Submission Journeys**

The submissions process must support a diverse set of users — from community members and First Nations contributors to internal analysts and system custodians. These users interact with the process in different ways, depending on their goals, responsibilities, and context. To design an inclusive and scalable experience, five distinct submission journeys have been defined. These journeys represent the primary modes of interaction with the submissions process.

Each journey is linked to a representative user archetype — a simplified model of behaviour, motivation, and need — which helps guide design, policy, and technology decisions throughout the process.

**Table 2: Submission Journeys Outline**

| Journey | Description | Related Archetype |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Engaged Contribution** | Individuals and groups preparing and submitting content to be considered in the Review. | Engaged Contributor |
| **Process Coordination** | Staff triaging, managing, and progressing submissions through internal review stages. | Process Steward |
| **Platform oversight** | IT and data custodians ensuring systems are secure, accessible, and operational. | Platform Guardian |
| **Compliance Assurance** | Legal and governance staff managing consent, privacy, ICIP, and FoI obligations. | Compliance Custodian |
| **Insight Generation** | Analysts and decision-makers extracting meaning from submissions to shape Review outcomes. | Strategic Synthesiser |

These journeys are not mutually exclusive — a user may move between them over time — but they provide a structured way to analyse, design, and support interactions throughout the submissions process. Archetypes will be developed in more detail in later sections to inform system design, engagement strategy, and internal workflows.

6. **Strategic Alignment with MDBA Digital Strategy**

This service concept has been designed to align closely with the MDBA Digital Strategy 2023–25, ensuring that the solution not only meets the functional needs of stakeholders but is also consistent with the authority's broader digital, governance, and operational objectives.

MDBA's digital strategy outlines four pillars of transformation:

* **Digital Workplace and Service Accessibility**

* **Information Management and Governance**

* **ICT Operations and Resilience**

* **Data Ethics, Privacy and Risk**

The submissions service directly contributes to these goals through:

* **Automation and digitisation of high-volume processes**, replacing email and manual handling

* **User-centred interface design** to support inclusivity and trust

* **Metadata-rich records and compliance integration**, aligning with DAMF and FOI protocols

* **Consent, ICIP and publication controls**, supporting CARE principles and transparent consideration.

Design principles such as Compliance by Design, User-Centred Inclusion, and Data Stewardship and Sovereignty are embedded across journey phases and service interactions. These are reinforced by technology features like secure cloud hosting, automated redaction workflows, and real-time intake monitoring — all aligned with MDBA's ambition to modernise and consolidate digital service delivery.

For a full mapping of design and system features to MDBA strategic priorities, see [**Appendix J.**](#bookmark=id.dpuf99aptdza)

2. **Service Design**

   1. **Design Principles**

The following principles underpin the design of the Basin Plan Review submissions process. They ensure the service is inclusive, compliant, efficient, and respectful of all stakeholders — particularly First Nations peoples and public contributors. These principles reflect legislative obligations, system design best practice, and user-centred values surfaced during the Discovery Phase. They guide how the submissions process should be built, managed, and experienced across all phases and journeys.

**Table 5: Insert Table of Design Principles**

| Design Principle | Description |
| :---: | ----- |
| 🔐Compliance by Design | Embed Water Act, Privacy, FoI, ICIP, and accessibility obligations from the outset — not as a postscript. |
| 🧍‍♀️User-Centred Inclusion | Design services that are intuitive, accessible, and respectful of diverse users, including those with cultural, regional, or technological barriers. |
| ⚙️Configure Before Code | Prioritise proven, configurable platforms and processes over bespoke development to maximise maintainability and alignment with MDBA EA principles. |
| 📈Scalable and Flexible | Support a wide range of submission formats and volumes — from individual citizens to mass campaigns — without degrading performance or experience. |
| 🛡️Data Stewardship and Sovereignty | Ensure secure, onshore data handling with respect for Indigenous knowledge protocols, aligned to DAMF and ICIP safeguards. |
| 👁️Transparent Consideration and Feedback | Provide submitters with confidence that their input is received, understood, and contributes to Review outcomes. |
| 🧭Ethical and Respectful Engagement | Honour cultural protocols, support Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), and treat all contributions with integrity and care. |

2. **Design Elements**

While the design principles define the values underpinning the submissions process, the design elements translate those principles into tangible service features, behaviours, and system characteristics. These elements ensure that the intent of the process — inclusivity, defensibility, clarity, and ease of use — is reflected in every interaction, from front-end user interfaces to back-end workflows and governance structures.

Each design element is specific enough to guide development and decision-making, yet broad enough to allow for flexibility across different platforms, delivery models, and engagement scenarios. They function as a toolkit to shape service behaviours, helping delivery teams and policy leads consistently align to the process vision. These elements will also inform future system configurations, implementation roadmaps, and service testing activities.

3. **Service Concept**

This section sets out the core journeys (and associated service blueprints) that define how different archetypes will interact with the Basin Plan Review submissions process. These journeys are informed by legislative obligations, operational insights, and user research conducted during the discovery phase.

Each journey represents a distinct pathway through the submissions process, aligned to a specific user archetype and their interaction with the system. Together, they capture the diversity of user needs — from members of the public making a submission, to internal staff processing and analysing that submission, to those responsible for platform integrity, legal compliance, and strategic reporting.

The journeys include:

* **Engaged Contribution** — the experience of community members and stakeholders preparing and submitting their views

* **Process Coordination** — the workflow followed by MDBA staff managing intake, triage, and submission handling

* **Platform oversight** — the responsibilities of ICT and data custodians in ensuring a secure, accessible, and scalable system

* **Compliance Assurance** — the legal and privacy checks that underpin responsible submission handling and publication

* **Insight Generation** — the activities of analysts and executives drawing meaning from submissions to shape review outcomes.

These journeys form the basis for subsequent system design, user interface development, and internal capability alignment. They are not technical blueprints, but structured representations of the end-to-end experience from multiple perspectives.

1. **Scenarios**

To illustrate the breadth and complexity of user interactions with the submissions process, a series of representative scenarios were developed during the Design Phase. These are not exhaustive but highlight typical experiences aligned to each of the five submission journeys and their associated archetypes.

Each scenario reflects the needs, constraints, and expectations of users engaging with different parts of the process — from external community members making individual submissions to internal staff managing triage, compliance, and analysis workflows.

**Note:** External users were not available for direct engagement during this phase. Personas and archetypes have been developed based on desktop research and insights provided by MDBA staff to reflect representative user needs and behaviours.

**Table 4: Journey to Artefact Mapping**

| Journey | Scenario | Archetype |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Engaged Contribution** | A community member wishes to submit a personal story and video about local water conditions. | **Engaged Contributor** |
| **Process Coordination** | An MDBA team member receives 3,000 campaign submissions and needs to triage them efficiently. | **Process Steward** |
| **Platform oversight** | An IT administrator configures role-based access and redaction workflows for flagged content. | **Platform Guardian** |
| **Compliance Assurance** | A legal officer assesses whether a submission with ICIP content meets consent requirements. | **Compliance Custodian** |
| **Insight Generation** | A data analyst prepares a thematic dashboard summarising sentiment trends by topic cluster. | **Strategic Synthesiser** |

2. **Service Products overview**

The delivery of the Basin Plan Review (BPR) submissions process relies on a suite of service products—both digital and non-digital—that together make the service function as designed. These products are not standalone systems or artefacts, but essential components that support and enable user interactions, back-end processing, compliance, and feedback.

In the context of the BPR Submissions Process, service products include templates, consent forms, tracking mechanisms, communications materials, triage rulesets, and technical tools that directly support the end-to-end journey from Invitation to Feedback. They underpin how the process is delivered, measured, and experienced by both internal actors and external contributors.

Each product plays a specific role across the submission lifecycle stages and aligns to the design principles and service functions established earlier in this document. The full register of identified and recommended service products is included in [**Appendix F**](#bookmark=id.o7q8vsjmlpyy)

**Note:** As the process design matures, this list may evolve to accommodate final implementation needs and updated legislative or policy requirements.

9. **Compliance Assurance**

   1. **Overview**

The Compliance Assurance service type ensures that all legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations are met throughout the submission process lifecycle. This includes the management of consent, privacy, FoI, intellectual and cultural property (ICIP), defamation risk, and publication eligibility. It involves both proactive safeguards and reactive escalation pathways to ensure that submission handling is legally defensible and ethically sound.

This service type operates in close coordination with Process Coordination, Platform oversight, and Legal Services, and is critical to upholding MDBA’s obligations under the Water Act 2007, Privacy Act 1988, FoI Act 1982, and MDBA’s ICIP Protocols. It protects both contributors and the Authority by ensuring content is appropriately redacted, escalated, withheld, or published.

**Note:** Scope Clarification

This service type covers:

Consent model design and verification.  
○	ICIP and privacy risk identification and escalation.  
○	Legal assessment of content for publication or redaction.  
○	Retention and reuse risk management.  
○	FoI defensibility, legislative compliance, and audit support.

This service type does not cover:

○	Public portal design or consent capture UI (*covered in [**Engaged Contribution**](#bookmark=id.tp3r9l5pgfwv)*).  
○	Data storage and platform availability (*covered in [**Platform oversight**](#bookmark=id.tt80l95em7eq)*).

| Feedback Loop | User feedback is collected during and post-submission period for process refinement. |

4. **Review and Improvement**

The operating model supports a cadence of review and refinement aligned to the broader Basin Plan Review program lifecycle.

| Activity | Frequency / Trigger |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Quarterly Continuous Improvement** | Scheduled review of performance, risks, and user experience. |
| **Post-Review Analysis** | Lessons learned captured after each submissions cycle and integrated into design updates. |
| **Governance Review** | Annual reconfirmation of roles, escalation pathways, and risk frameworks. |

5. **Operating Model Overview**

The following workflow diagram illustrates the roles, responsibilities, and governance domains involved in the end-to-end operation of the Basin Plan Review submissions process. It highlights how accountability is distributed across the BPR team, ICT, and governance groups — with clear delineation between business process ownership, platform support, and compliance oversight. It also indicates where collaboration and cooperation are essential across teams to ensure cohesive delivery, coordinated risk management, and aligned decision-making throughout the BPR process lifecycle.

7. **Transition to BAU and Service Ownership**

The submissions process will transition from project delivery to business-as-usual (BAU) operations following completion of system readiness and post-submission reporting.

* **Process Ownership:** Remains with the BPR Program Team, who oversee policies, user support, and reporting alignment.

* **System Ownership:** Transferred to ICT Services once stability and operational KPIs are confirmed.

* **Support Model:** First-line support via Service Desk; second-line through ICT and specialist SMEs (Legal, Privacy, ICIP).

* **Catalogue Entry:** This service will be registered as a Tier 1 ICT-supported business service in MDBA’s Service Catalogue, with defined SLA, dependencies, and ownership metadata.

  8. **Operating Assumptions**

Effective operation of the submissions process relies on the following **baseline assumptions:**

* Legal and ICIP review resources are available during peak intake and publication windows.

* ICT capacity supports performance scaling (5,000–10,000 submissions).

* Consent and publication rules are pre-agreed and documented before intake opens.

* Service support model and escalation pathways are communicated to all operational staff.

* Records management protocols (retention, disposal, metadata) are finalised before archive handoff.

  9. **Performance and Success Measures**

To ensure the service delivers value and remains fit-for-purpose, operational performance will be monitored against key metrics. These support continuous improvement cycles and strategic alignment with MDBA’s digital and corporate objectives.

**Table 12: Performance & Success Measures**

| Metric | Target / Expectation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Submission processing time | 90% within 5 business days of receipt |
| Redaction turnaround | 100% of flagged submissions reviewed within 7 days |
| System uptime during intake window | ≥ 99.9% |
| Perceived Transparency and Process Fairness | 70%+ of respondents indicate they understood how their submission was handled and considered |
| Audit and FOI readiness | All published content supported by defensible audit trail |

10. **Service Lifecycle and Legacy Management**

The Basin Plan Review submissions process is not a permanent business service — **but it is a strategically significant national program** that warrants investment, robust design, and effective operational stewardship.

The lifecycle of this service should be deliberately managed in **three distinct phases**:

**1\. Stand-Up and Commissioning**

The service must be designed, configured, tested, and launched with confidence. This includes:

* Establishing secure infrastructure and compliance workflows

* Defining roles and onboarding staff

* Registering the service in MDBA’s catalogue with agreed SLAs

* Preparing guidance and artefacts for internal and public users

**2\. Active Operation**

During the public submission window and analysis period, the service must remain:

* Secure, available, and monitored

* Adaptable to submission volume and campaign activity

* Auditable and governed in line with FOI, ICIP, and Privacy obligations

* Supported by defined escalation and decision frameworks

**3\. Controlled Closure and Knowledge Transfer**

Once the submission cycle is complete and outputs are published:

* The system should transition into a low-maintenance archive state

* All metadata, decision logs, redactions, and ICIP indicators must be preserved

* Lessons learned, insights, artefacts, and process models must be **captured and archived** to inform the **2036 Basin Plan Review**

* The service may be mothballed but must remain discoverable and referenceable for future programs and policy reviews

The value of this service lies not just in what it delivers in 2026, but in how it supports MDBA’s institutional memory, improves the next review cycle, and reinforces MDBA’s commitment to transparency and respectful engagement.

5. **Capability Map**

The capability map outlines the business and technical capabilities required to support delivery and operation of the Basin Plan Review submissions process. It provides a foundation for planning, sourcing, and aligning resourcing across process, platform, and people — and ensures the service is sustainable, auditable, and strategically aligned.

Capabilities have been grouped into **Tier 1 Domains**, each supported by a set of **Tier 2 Capabilities**, and are mapped to phases of the submission lifecycle. This structure allows MDBA to identify dependencies, assign ownership, and assess maturity over time.

6. **Functional Requirements Summary**

This section defines the core functional capabilities required to support the end-to-end Basin Plan Review submissions process. These requirements translate the service concept and user journeys into tangible system behaviours — ensuring that submissions can be received, triaged, reviewed, and reported on in a way that is compliant, user-centred, and operationally feasible. Each function is directly tied to identified archetype needs, legal obligations, and blueprint scenarios, and will guide the implementation and configuration of the supporting platform.

| ID | Requirement | System Behaviour / Feature | Input/Trigger | Output / Dependency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-01** | Multi-format Intake | Accept submissions via multiple intake channels including portal (short/detailed), kiosk (Riverside Chats), email, and physical mail.

| **FR-03** | ICIP Declaration and Handling | Submitters must be given the opportunity to declare if their submission contains Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP). The declaration must be offered across all submission channels. If ICIP is declared, the system must flag the submission and initiate the ICIP review workflow. Where submissions are received via email or mail and ICIP is not explicitly declared, staff must assess indicators (keywords, content themes) and apply ICIP\_flag \= true only where clearly evident. Unclear cases default to ICIP\_flag \= false. | Submission intake via portal, kiosk, email, or physical mail | ICIP\_flag: true/false; audit trail entry; trigger to ICIP Review Coordinator (if true) |
| **FR-04** | Submitter Publication Preference | System must capture whether the submitter consents to being named in any published output. Consent must be explicit across all channels. For non-portal submissions (email, physical mail, kiosk), back-office staff must review and record consent status during upload based on submission content or provided declaration. If unclear or absent, system must default to anonymous publication (publication\_consent \= false). | Submission intake | publication\_consent=true/false metadata field |
| **FR-05** | Campaign Detection Engine | Detect pattern-matching submissions (e.g. via template similarity, email domains, volume spikes); flag as campaign-type. | Submission metadata \+ pattern DB | campaign\_tag=true |

Used for workflow management, ageing, and reporting. | Workflow state change | review\_status metadata field; visible on internal dashboards only \+ Audit tracking |
| **FR-09** | Redaction Workflow | Route flagged submissions to Legal; redact inline or full submission; tag reason code (FOI, ICIP, Defamation). | Legal or ICIP trigger | Redacted submission; redaction reason |
| **FR-10** | SME Routing | Tag submission for SME; notify user group; allow markup/comments and decision recommendation. | Manual or metadata route | SME feedback object |
| **FR-11** | Insight Curation | Allow analysts to flag sections, quote text, and add tags for reporting; store link to source submission ID. | Analyst action | Quote repository \+ theme tag |
| **FR-12** | Report Generation Engine | Compile themed quotes, topics, campaign data, and flagged submissions into draft report (Markdown, Word, or HTML). | Report trigger | Exportable report |
| **FR-13** | Monitoring Dashboard | Display real-time graphs for volume, campaign activity, redaction load, tag distribution; backend polling every 5 min. | System activity | Dashboard UI \+ alert triggers |
| **FR-14** | Full Audit Logging | Record user actions per submission incl. view, redact, tag, comment, or publish; store immutable log. | User/system action | Time-stamped audit log |
| **FR-15** | Metadata Export \+ Records Integration | Export submission and metadata bundle to MDBA archive; apply retention rules and classification; generate export manifest. | Submission lifecycle end | Archive package \+ manifest |
| **FR-16** | Automated Notifications | The system must send automated email notifications to internal and external users for key actions such as submission receipt, status updates, and publication of submissions or reports | Submission events (e.g. submitted, reviewed, published) | Email alerts triggered to appropriate users |
| **FR-17** | Data Validation | The system must automatically validate data fields against predefined rules and flag errors or incomplete entries | Form completion and submission attempt | Validation error messages or acceptance confirmation |
| **FR-18** | Publication Management | Submissions designated as public must be published online in an accessible, searchable format. | Designation of submission as public | Public listing on portal |
| **FR-19** | Bulk Handling | Ability to bulk export, assign, or publish multiple submissions (e.g. handling identical campaign submissions efficiently). | Admin action on grouped submissions | Batch operation output; audit trail |
| **FR-20** | Publication Workflow | The system must support a controlled publication workflow including consent verification, redaction review, status assignment, bulk handling, approval tagging, and audit trail generation prior to publishing public submissions. The workflow must ensure compliance with publication rules and support transparent, traceable actions. | Submission approval or publication flag | Published submission; audit log; publication\_status=true |

**Table 15: Supported Submission Channels & Formats**

*Expanded detail from FR-01 to ensure shared understanding of all supported intake modes.*

| **Governance & Oversight** | Escalation and oversight pathways | All phases | Operating Model swimlanes; ARG involvement; CI cadence | Governance Group |

**Note:** Controls have been embedded as functional requirements (Section 6), design principles and elements (Section 3.6 & 3.7), and process roles (Section 4). Compliance checkpoints should be periodically reviewed and validated through internal audit or review mechanisms.

**Appendix D**  
Data & Privacy Flow Map

This appendix describes the flow of submission data from intake to archival, highlighting key privacy protection points, consent triggers, and data classification activities. The flow aligns with the requirements of the *Privacy Act 1988*, MDBA’s **Data and Metadata Framework (DAMF)**, and relevant obligations under the **Water Act 2007, FOI**, and **ICIP governance principles**.

## **D.1 Overview Flow Description** {#d.1-overview-flow-description}

Submission data passes through six primary stages, each with distinct privacy obligations and technical controls:

1. **Submission Intake**  
   * Data is received via portal, kiosk, email, or physical mail.  
   * Consent for identification and ICIP is captured (explicit for digital channels, inferred or staff-logged for manual channels).  
   * Metadata applied at entry: source, timestamp, ICIP flag, publication consent, etc.  
2. **Validation & Triage**  
   * Submissions are tagged (e.g. campaign, anonymous, ICIP).  
   * Basic redactions may occur at this stage if sensitive content is flagged.  
   * Non-compliant submissions are quarantined.  
3. **Review & Analysis**  
   * Content analysed by authorised internal users (e.g. Analysts, Legal).  
   * Further metadata added (themes, issues, tone).  
   * ICIP and legal review workflows triggered where relevant.  
4. **Publication Preparation**  
   * Only content with consent is attributed by name.  
   * Redactions (e.g. PII, defamation, ICIP) applied before export.  
   * Content passed into *“What We’ve Heard”* or analytical outputs.  
5. **Export & Reporting**  
   * Data exported into Power BI dashboards and structured reports.  
   * Submitter identities included only where authorised.  
   * Report metadata includes tags for audit and FOI traceability.  
6. **Retention & Archival**  
   * Final data packages stored with retention flags per DAMF.  
   * Legal holds and ICIP safeguards override normal archival flow.  
   * Export formats compatible with FOI and future public release.

## **D.2 Privacy Safeguards by Stage** {#d.2-privacy-safeguards-by-stage}

| Stage | Key Safeguards |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Intake** | Explicit consent capture (ID/ICIP); staff scripts; WCAG-compliant forms; metadata tagging |
| **Triage** | System quarantine rules; tagging engine; secure S3/Blob storage; input validation |
| **Review** | Role-based access; audit trail; ICIP & legal approval workflows |
| **Publication** | Redaction module; defamation/ICIP checks; quote authorisation filters |
| **Export** | Filtered datasets; de-identified exports where required |
| **Archive** | DAMF-aligned classification; legal hold mechanism; long-term retrieval support |

**Appendix F**  
Service Products

This attachment outlines the core service products required to operationalise the Basin Plan Review submissions process. These products enable users to engage effectively, support internal workflows, and ensure compliance with legislative and ethical obligations. Some products are user-facing (external), while others support internal teams in managing, triaging, and reporting on submissions.

The service products listed here are aligned with the customer journeys, design principles, and system requirements described in the main Service Concept document. They span the full lifecycle of the submissions process — from public invitation to archival — and will form the foundation for implementation, co-design, and system development activities.

**Note:** List may change as service design is refined and moves from this concept into a more detailed stage.

**Disclaimer:**

This model is intended as a **logical reference only**. It reflects insights gathered during the discovery and design phases and is provided to support high-level alignment across governance, digital, and operational domains.

The data structure shown in this appendix is **not a** **formal schema specification**.

Any future implementation must be preceded by detailed business analysis, information governance review, and solution architecture planning. Field names, formats, and workflows are subject to refinement based on technical constraints, platform selection, and legal or privacy requirements at the time of build.

**Appendix I**  
Workflow Register

This appendix documents the core workflows underpinning the service concept. Each workflow describes a repeatable operational process that enables secure, compliant, and efficient handling of submissions throughout their lifecycle. These workflows are conceptual in nature and must be further validated and refined during detailed process design, business analysis, and system implementation.

**Note:** This register supports traceability to functional requirements (Section 6), service blueprints (Section 3), and the operating model (Section 4).

**Appendix J**  
Service Concept Background

## **The purpose of the service concept** {#the-purpose-of-the-service-concept}

The Service Concept provides a structured vision for how the Basin Plan Review submissions process will work in practice — from the perspective of users, staff, and systems. It acts as a foundational artefact that bridges stakeholder needs, legislative requirements, and digital implementation.

It describes the intended service experience, clarifies process logic and roles, and identifies the capabilities required to deliver a compliant, respectful, and efficient consultation process. The concept is not a solution blueprint or technical specification — rather, it sets out the “*what*” and “*why*” of the service so that the “*how*” can be developed in alignment with user needs, legal obligations, and MDBA's digital strategy.

It is used to:

* Guide co-design and validate shared understanding across stakeholders

* Align service delivery with strategic, legal, and ethical objectives

* Enable structured analysis of roles, risks, data, and decision points

* Inform future implementation, procurement, and review activities

**Note:** This document forms part of Phase 3 of the design process and should be read in conjunction with supporting materials, including the Discovery Brief, service blueprints, and capability model.

**Appendix K**  
Strategic Crosswalk

**Appendix N**  
Submission Process \+ DAMF Alignment Swimlane

## **Purpose**

This appendix presents the integrated **Service \+ DAMF Process Swimlane** for the Basin Plan Review Submissions Process. It visually maps the complete end-to-end operational workflow across key actors, technology systems, decision points, and data governance responsibilities, while explicitly identifying the alignment with MDBA’s **Data and Analytics Management Framework (DAMF)**.

The diagram serves as both:

* a **service design artefact** (to define the intended end-to-end user and staff experience);

* a **data governance artefact** (to ensure traceability of data as it moves through DAMF stages and is subject to statutory obligations).

## **Context**

The Service Concept (Section 3\) outlines five core journeys:

* Engaged Contribution

* Process Coordination

* Platform Oversight

* Compliance Assurance

* Insight Generation

This swimlane supplements those journeys by:

* adding the explicit DAMF data lifecycle steps of **Plan, Collect, Collate, Process, Analyse, Publish, Preserve, Describe** as defined in the DAMF Guidelines;

* defining how each process phase interacts with data lineage, consent capture, ICIP labelling, redaction, triage, routing, analysis, publication, and archival governance;

* clarifying the integration points between human workflows and MDBA data governance expectations and tools (e.g. DAMF Maps, DAMF Catalogue, MDIP integration).

## **Key Features of the Swimlane**

The following enhancements have been added to reflect 2025 design thinking:

* Addition of the **Consideration Workflow** as a formal decision point to ensure MDBA can demonstrate compliance with the legislative obligation to consider all submissions under Section 51 of the Water Act 2007MDBA\_BPR Process Design…MDBA\_BPR2026\_S\&I\_Deep\_D…MDBA\_BPR2026\_Legal-Deep….

* Introduction of the **Quotation Engine** to enable traceable thematic referencing of submission content into reporting products, such as the What We’ve Heard Report.

* Accommodation of semi-automated and human-in-the-loop **LLM \+ AI-powered data synthesis tools** to assist with bulk campaign handling and thematic analysis;

* Clear process states aligned to DAMF status tracking:

* **Draft (Blue)** – working and incomplete records

* **QA Evaluation (Red)** – reviewed and evaluated data

* **Authorised Product (Gold)** – final records approved for publication and reporting

## **Alignment to MDBA Frameworks**

This artefact ensures direct traceability to the following MDBA design and governance artefacts:

* **MDBA Enterprise Architecture Framework** (principles of Configure-before-Code; Reuse-before-Build; Microsoft stack preference; traceability of data objects)

* **MDBA Data Integration Platform Reference Architecture** (MDIP) (automated pipelines, quality controls, metadata enrichment, records lineage)

* **MDBA DAMF Guide and Mapping Templates** (data lifecycle governance, DAMF Maps and Catalogue)

* **MDBA Digital Strategy 2023–2025** (alignment to digital workplace, platform governance, data stewardship, and operating model objectives)

## **Usage Note**

This process swimlane is intended to be a living design artefact. It should be updated as the BPR Submissions Process progresses through design, build, and operational delivery phases. The diagram provides a single source of truth for process validation, technical vendor alignment, and internal governance decision points.

All future design decisions for the BPR Submissions System should reference this swimlane to:

* validate DAMF compliance;

* identify service blueprint gaps;

* maintain traceable lineage of any system and process changes that could impact data governance obligations.

## **Summary Recommendations**

### **Option 1: D365 \+ Power Apps**

* Most closely aligned to MDBA Digital Strategy and Enterprise Architecture Framework.

* Re-uses existing investment in Microsoft stack (Azure, Power BI, D365).

* Simplifies governance, consent, ICIP tagging, and automation via low-code configuration.

* Strongly preferred option for lowest implementation risk and long-term supportability.

### **Option 2: .NET \+ React**

* Provides ultimate flexibility and full control over design and user experience.

* Suitable for complex ICIP or consent workflows beyond off-the-shelf capability.

* Highest cost, longest delivery time, and requires long-term resourcing commitment.

* Suitable only if custom or unique requirements cannot be met by Option 1\.

### **Option 3: Salesforce**

* Highly capable of delivering robust case management and triage workflows.

* Misaligned with MDBA’s Microsoft cloud strategy and Azure Data Integration Platform.

* Would require duplication of reporting and data lake integration effort.

### **Option 4: External COTS Vendors**

* May offer fast delivery and packaged portals but are unlikely to meet MDBA privacy and ICIP compliance needs without major configuration effort.

* Typically lack deep Power BI integration or Azure-native data flow.

### **Option 5: Low-Code Platforms**

* Useful for rapid prototyping or departmental apps.

* Not recommended for core business critical workloads at scale.

* Higher long-term licence and maintenance costs; lower public sector footprint in Australia.

## **Conclusion**

Based on MDBA’s defined functional and non-functional requirements, security, privacy, data governance, and enterprise architecture principles, **Option 1 (Microsoft D365 \+ Power Platform)** is the recommended solution.

**Option 2 (.NET \+ React)** remains a viable fallback should highly unique requirements emerge during detailed design phases that cannot be met by Power Platform capabilities.
