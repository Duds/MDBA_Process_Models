# Basin Plan Review Analysis Phase Context

## Overview

The Analysis Phase manages the initial assessment of submissions received during the Basin Plan Review (BPR) Collection Phase. It ensures each submission is correctly validated, categorised, and triaged to the appropriate Theme Lead for detailed review. This phase is particularly focused on identifying submissions containing Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), as well as high-value content that warrants prioritised consideration.

## Business Context

### Purpose
- Validate submissions for completeness, relevance, and appropriateness
- Identify and handle ICIP content according to established protocols
- Categorise submissions by theme, stakeholder type, and geographic relevance
- Triage submissions to the appropriate Theme Leads
- Prioritise high-value submissions with significant strategic insights

### Stakeholders
- **MDBA BPR PMO**: Manages the overall submission review process
- **First Nations Team**: Provides expertise in ICIP identification and handling
- **Theme Leads**: Accept assigned submissions and identify high-value content
- **Submitters**: May be contacted for clarification if submissions are incomplete or unclear

### Regulatory Framework
- **Water Act 2007**: Requires consideration of all valid submissions
- **Basin Plan 2012**: Provides thematic structure for categorisation
- **ICIP Protocols**: Guides appropriate handling of Indigenous knowledge and cultural content
- **Privacy Act 1988**: Ensures appropriate handling of personal information

## Process Context

### Inputs
- Valid submissions from multiple channels (online portal, email, and hard copy)
- Submission metadata (submitter details, timestamps, format, etc.)
- ICIP identification guidelines and protocols
- BPR thematic framework for categorisation

### Outputs
- Validated and categorised submissions
- ICIP content identified and secured
- Submissions assigned to appropriate Theme Leads
- High-value submissions flagged for prioritised consideration
- Invalid submissions documented and excluded from further review

### Dependencies
- Completion of the Collection Phase
- Availability of First Nations Team for ICIP review
- Accessibility of submission repository and tracking system
- Theme Lead availability and expertise alignment

### Constraints
- Resource limitations for processing high volumes of submissions
- Tight timelines for completion to meet overall BPR schedule
- Cultural sensitivity requirements for ICIP content
- Consistent application of validation and categorisation criteria

## Process Design Decisions

### Key Decisions
1. **Three-Tier Validation**: Submissions are validated for completeness, relevance, and appropriateness
2. **ICIP Identification Protocol**: Three-step process (self-identification, keyword detection, manual review)
3. **Campaign Submission Handling**: Similar submissions from coordinated campaigns are grouped
4. **Theme-Based Categorisation**: Aligned with the four key themes in the Discussion Paper
5. **High-Value Prioritisation**: Process to identify and escalate strategically valuable submissions

### Design Rationale
- Early ICIP identification ensures respectful handling from the outset
- Thematic categorisation ensures submissions reach the most appropriate subject matter experts
- Campaign submission grouping prevents duplication of effort while acknowledging public sentiment
- High-value prioritisation ensures significant insights receive adequate attention
- Invalid submission tracking ensures transparency and completeness

## Success Criteria

### Process Metrics
- **Validation Throughput**: 80+ submissions processed per day at peak
- **ICIP Handling Accuracy**: 100% of ICIP content correctly identified and secured
- **Categorisation Accuracy**: 95%+ submissions correctly assigned to themes
- **Triage Timeliness**: All submissions triaged within 5 business days of receipt
- **Error Rates**: <2% rework due to incorrect validation or categorisation

### Quality Gates
- ICIP content confirmation by First Nations Team
- Theme Lead acceptance of triaged submissions
- High-value determination verification
- Invalid submission review prior to exclusion

## Risk Management

### Key Risks
1. **ICIP Mishandling**: Failure to identify or appropriately handle Indigenous knowledge
2. **Validation Inconsistency**: Inconsistent application of validation criteria
3. **Categorisation Errors**: Submissions assigned to incorrect Theme Leads
4. **Resource Bottlenecks**: Insufficient staff for timely processing during peak submission periods
5. **High-Value Oversight**: Missing strategically important submissions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **ICIP Training**: Comprehensive training for all staff on ICIP identification
2. **Validation Guidelines**: Clear criteria and examples for submission validation
3. **Categorisation Review**: Sample audits of categorisation decisions
4. **Resource Planning**: Staffing based on anticipated submission volumes
5. **Multiple Review Layers**: Several opportunities to identify high-value content

## Related Processes
- **Collection Phase**: Precedes Analysis and provides submissions for review
- **Consideration Phase**: Follows Analysis and performs detailed review of submissions
- **Publication Phase**: Runs in parallel and publishes submissions with appropriate permissions

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- Volume of submissions processed daily
- Percentage of submissions containing ICIP
- Distribution across themes and stakeholder types
- Average processing time per submission
- Invalid submission rate
- High-value submission identification rate

### Reporting Requirements
- Daily processing statistics
- Weekly categorisation summary
- ICIP content register
- Theme assignment distribution
- High-value submission register
- Invalid submission log with justifications

## Maintenance and Change Management

### Responsible Teams
- MDBA BPR PMO owns the overall process
- First Nations Team oversees ICIP handling procedures
- Theme Leads participate in theme categorisation refinement

### Update Procedures
- Process refinements based on weekly review of metrics
- Adjustment of validation criteria if needed
- Theme categorisation framework updates as required
- ICIP protocol updates in consultation with First Nations Team
